The Birdsong Group operates under a set of core values that drive the way we do things as a team. I think it’s really important to know your core values. Whether in real estate or any other line of work, it’s important for you to have core values and write them down. Our core values support our vision, share our culture, and reflect what’s important to the people that work for us.

The Birdsong Group’s core values are:

**1. Treat everyone with respect.** This seems like a given, but it’s not always true in this world.

**2. Build a positive team.** We want to feel like a family.

**3. Have honest and open communication.** This isn’t something you find everywhere either.

**4. Build a positive attitude that produces positive results.**

**5. Serve the community and others.** We support the Second Harvest Food Bank and many other local organizations.

**6. Never stop learning.** This is especially important for in real estate, where every transaction is a learning experience.

**7. Have fun. Laugh often.** Sometimes this is a stressful job, but it’s important to always keep others in mind and help them with a smile.

**8. Put clients first.** We want to exceed our clients’ expectations.

**9. Follow up, follow up, and follow up again.** This is probably the most important one.

If you take core values like this to heart and demonstrate them in your daily work, I guarantee you’ll be successful. If you want to learn more about our team or you have questions about the business, in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
