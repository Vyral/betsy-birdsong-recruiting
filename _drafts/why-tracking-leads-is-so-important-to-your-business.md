Today I’m going to talk to you about the importance of tracking where your leads come from. Many of us salespeople don’t like to get bogged down into the details, but **it’s very important to get into the habit of tracking your numbers so you know what you’re doing and where things are coming from.**

First, you’re going to want to have a system where you can enter and track your leads, commonly referred to as a CRM. There are a bunch of good ones out there. **Once you pick one, you can put all of your lead’s information in and where they came from so you can track them in the future.** Whether they came from Google, Facebook, or somewhere else, you’ll be able to track the source.

**Next, you should enter all of your sphere of influence leads into the database and categorize them.** You’ll also want to keep track of all your past clients within the CRM as well. Once you’ve sold someone a house, enter them into that past client database so you can stay in touch with them.

**Finally, you'll need to enter any and all referrals to the database and who or what referred them.** It’s important to track conversions to sales as well. If you have thousands of leads but none of them convert to sales, then they’ve done nothing for you.

The biggest advantage of tracking all of these leads, past clients, etc., is because you want to make sure that you’re putting your marketing dollars into those avenues that are generating the most leads and leading to conversions.

I know many of your are awesome salespeople and might not be thrilled about the idea of tracking all these numbers. However, **you still need to know where you’re spending your money and where the best way to spend money is so that you can grow your business and continue to have consistent income.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
