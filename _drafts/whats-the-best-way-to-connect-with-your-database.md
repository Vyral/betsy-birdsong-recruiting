To connect with your database in the New Orleans area, I’ve found that **it’s important to make one call every quarter to each person in your database, and then do a direct mail piece once a month.** By connecting with your database on a regular basis, you should be able to generate referrals, and that’s what you’re striving for.&nbsp;

Your database is full of people who make up your sphere of influence (SOI). If you don’t have an SOI, you need to start building one. The key to doing this is to write down the names of everyone you know and categorize them into a list of “A,” “B,” and “C,” clients.&nbsp;

The “A” clients are your best clients, or those who you believe have a good chance of sending you referrals.&nbsp;

The “B” clients are those who’ve already referred someone to you.

The “C” clients are new people you’ll add to your database on a regular basis. Additionally, you should make a subcategory of “C-A” clients who are most likely to refer someone to you because of who they know. All you have to do is educate them on how to send you a referral. You’re not “training” them by any means—you’re just coaching them a little on what you’re looking for and how they can help you. If they’re people you know and they like and trust you, then they’ll want to help you.&nbsp;

**Picking up the phone and calling each of these people once a quarter can be difficult, but it’s even more difficult to sustain a real estate business if you’re not willing to do this.** Also, remember that to send each of these people a direct mail piece once a month, you’ll need to get their addresses.&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about how to build your database or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me a text. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
