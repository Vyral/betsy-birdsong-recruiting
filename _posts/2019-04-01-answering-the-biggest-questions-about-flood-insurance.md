It’s incredibly important for real estate agents to have a clear understanding of flood insurance and what it means for your clients. I get a lot of questions about it, so today I’d like to go over the basics of this type of insurance.

**First, you need to find out what the property’s flood zone is.** You can find this out in Matrix, and if you don’t know how, reach out to me so I can walk you through it. If you can’t access Matrix, you can contact your insurance agent as well.

**Lenders don’t require flood insurance for X, B, or C zones**; however, this doesn’t mean that the property doesn’t need it. Flood insurance for these zones is inexpensive, and its price will be based on the price of the house and the kind of coverage people want.

**Flood insurance for an A zone, though, could be a lot more expensive**. Its coverage will be based on the house and how high off the ground it is compared to the base flood elevation of the area. To find this out, you’ll need to get a flood elevation survey done. If you’re working with a buyer, ask the seller to provide this or pay for one. Your buyer needs to know if they’ll be able to afford flood insurance in addition to the property itself.

**If you’re listing a property, it’s important to know the flood rate**—it can affect the price of a property. If it’s in an A zone with expensive flood insurance, the house won’t be able to sell for as much. Ask your seller for a copy of the flood declaration page; it should be included with the seller disclosures in the MLS. Some agents don’t want to include this if the flood insurance is high, but there’s not much you can do about it. By not including it, you’re wasting people’s time.

By understanding flood insurance, you’ll be able to give your buyers and sellers better service. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
