How can you maximize open houses to generate more listings and find buyers? Here are a few tips and tricks that will help you. 

First, know that **it’s much better to do open houses here in New Orleans on a Sunday.** There’s much more foot traffic, and the best time to capture this foot traffic is between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The second best time is between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. 

To produce a lot of foot traffic, there are several things you can do. On our team, we put up a lot of directional signs in the surrounding area. I usually hire someone to do this so that my agents and I don’t have to worry about taking all of them down after we’re done with the open house. 

We also stick flags in the front yard, distribute flyers (if it’s our first open house of the neighborhood), and use targeted Facebook ads—these ads are very effective, and they’re something you need to learn how to utilize for your business.

Additionally, **we call the neighbors before all of our open houses.** This is something very few agents do, but we do it. We usually make about 250 calls around the neighborhood and tell people on the other end of the line that we’re having an open house and they’re invited to a private showing. 

We then schedule this private showing an hour before the regularly scheduled showing so we know that the people who come early are the neighbors. It’s important to know which attendees are neighbors and which aren’t, so this is a good way to keep them separated. We also use this early showing as an opportunity to tell the neighbors that we’re the go-to real estate team in the area and we can take care of their open house if they’re thinking of selling.
