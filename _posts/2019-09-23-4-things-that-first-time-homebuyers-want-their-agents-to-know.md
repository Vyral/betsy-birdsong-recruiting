There are four things, in particular, that first-time homebuyers want you to know about them and what they’re going through:

**1\. They’re terrified that they don’t have enough money.** It isn’t something they really want to talk about. Sometimes you have to ask the right questions and dive in a little bit deeper than they’re willing to tell you off the top. They might be worried that what they’ve saved up hasn’t been enough. One thing first-time buyers are really clueless about are closing costs. They’re pretty high here in Louisiana because of insurance costs, so realize that most of your first-time buyer clients don’t know whether they have enough money or not so it’s your job to spell out all costs for them.

**2\. They’re looking for a reliable lender.** Most of them will not have a lender when they first come into your world, so it’s important to educate them about why having a reliable lender is so important. Most first-time buyers, unless they have a strong affiliation with a bank or credit union, will take your advice on lenders. It is important that you step up to the plate and help them out because you want them to have a good experience and a strong lender plays a key role in that.

**3\. They want an agent who they can trust, and they want them to trust you too.** You need to show them that you’re trusting them and that they can trust you. It’s a two-way street.

**4\. Don’t assume they love all the technology you have.** Even with a younger demographic, you think all millennials want all the technology. Don’t make that assumption. There are plenty of millennials that don’t mind talking on the phone as their preferred method of communication. There are some that prefer email or text, but just go with whatever they want. Don't assume, just ask. This is also important for contracts that are sent digitally. I like to go over contacts in person or on the phone with my clients to make sure they understand everything in it.&nbsp;

Those are just a few of the tips that you can use to attract more new homebuyers to your services. If you have any questions for me about working with first-time homebuyers or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
