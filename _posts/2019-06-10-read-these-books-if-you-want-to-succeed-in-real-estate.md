People often ask me which books I recommend most for growing their real estate business. There are so many titles I could include on this list, but today I’ll share just three of the most impactful books in my library.&nbsp;

**1\. “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill.** This book, which was written in the late 1930s, is one I’ve read time and time again. It covers concepts like faith, thought, and the value of “feeding the subconscious.” One of the key takeaways of this book is the idea that most of our actions come from our subconscious thoughts, rather than our conscious ones. Another major idea covered in the book is the importance of masterminding—meeting with your peers to discuss ideas related to your business. Everyone accomplishes more when they’re working together.

<br>**2\. “Eat That Frog” by Brian Tracy.** The phrase “eat that frog” is a metaphor for doing the most difficult tasks first. It’s human nature to delay unpleasant jobs, but when you “eat the frog” first, you’ll find that your work goes by faster and more efficiently.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. “The One Thing” by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan.** Before I read this book, I was building a real estate team, had started a credit-repair business, and was beginning to flip houses. When I finished the book, however, I shut down my side businesses and focused solely on the “one thing” that mattered most: my real estate business. The main idea of this book is that you must think big by going small. In other words, you need to narrow your focus if you want to achieve great things.&nbsp;

As you can tell by looking at this list, none of these books are about the point-by-point steps it takes to be successful in real estate. This is because I believe you need to grow your mind in order to grow your business. These books offer valuable lessons into the fundamental principles of success—not just success in real estate.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
