Around the United States, most new agents and many experienced agents choose to join a real estate team.&nbsp;

In our area, however, this trend doesn’t appear to be quite as prevalent. Unfortunately, this is detrimental to our success as professionals within the real estate industry.&nbsp;

**The simple truth is that we’re behind the times. But this can change.&nbsp;**

How? It starts on an individual level. Therefore, today I’d like to share a few things you should think about if you’re considering joining a real estate team.&nbsp;

First, **realize that a team environment isn’t for everyone, but it is a good fit for hard-working agents ready to sell houses and earn more money from doing so.&nbsp;**

The only real drawback to working on a team is that you won’t receive as much personal credit within the industry for your success. This doesn’t mean you won’t get any recognition, simply that you probably won’t be seeing your name appear in lights as a result of your strong real estate track record. If notoriety isn’t as important to you as financial stability and a fulfilling career, though, then joining a team is likely right for you.&nbsp;

**So how are teams set up?** Well, basically, different professionals take care of different aspects of the real estate process. There are listing agents, who deal with sellers; buyers agents, who work with buyers; and support staff, who offer back-end assistance to the team. On my team, specifically, my goal is to provide an excellent experience for everyone who works for me, and to every client we serve.&nbsp;

**To do this, I provide leads, training opportunities, and other valuable resources that you would have to seek out on your own if you were to work as an independent agent.** Still, a lot of agents get caught up on the idea of splits. My response to this is that 100% of zero is still zero. If working on a team brings you in more deals (which it almost certainly will), you can rest assured that you’ll still earn more in a collaborative environment with a split than you would by going it alone.&nbsp;

In short, joining a team is something I think agents in our area should seriously consider. If you have any other questions or would like more information about joining a team, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
