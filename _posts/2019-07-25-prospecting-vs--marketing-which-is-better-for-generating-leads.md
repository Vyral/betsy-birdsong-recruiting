Where should you focus your lead generation?&nbsp;

To answer this question, we must first break down lead generation into two categories: **prospecting and marketing.** It’s important to understand that each will require you to expend something.&nbsp;

**Prospecting will cost you time, whereas marketing will cost money.** When you’re deciding which you should place an emphasis on, ask yourself whether you have more time or more money.&nbsp;

If money is scarce, then you’re better off focusing your efforts on prospecting. Some examples of this include **For Sale By Owners, expired listings, working open houses, drumming up business from your sphere of influence, and basic networking.** Immerse yourself in community activities that give you opportunities to meet new people and pass out business cards.

If you have more money than time, on the other hand, aim to increase your marketing efforts. That means buying **radio ads, TV ads, and internet ads, in addition to advertising via direct mail and billboards. &nbsp;&nbsp;**

My advice is to market where consumers are, and it’s a well-known fact that most of today’s consumers are found on the internet, so this is where your marketing dollars should be spent first. You can work the other forms of marketing into your lead generation strategy once you build up your business and have the resources for it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
