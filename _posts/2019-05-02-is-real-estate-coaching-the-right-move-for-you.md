I’ve been told that real estate coaching is a billion dollar business in this country. I don’t know if that figure is accurate, but I do know that there are plenty of coaches, coaching programs, and real estate agents in those coaching programs. **There are all different kinds of coaches out there, so I wanted to give some advice for those of you who may be searching for some coaching in your real estate business.**

The first thing you need to do before hiring a coach is to figure out what your goals are and where you’re at right now in your business. Where do you want to be in the future? **When you’re very clear about those goals, you can go out and find what you’re looking for.** What you may find is that you aren’t in the right brokerage and you can get what you need from a different brokerage or team leader. If that’s the case, you may not even need to seek out coaching, which will cost you thousands.

When I first started in the business, I did hire a coach and I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish everything I did as quickly as I did without one. **At the same time, I made a lot of mistakes that I wouldn’t have if I was in a different environment.**

If you have any questions about real estate coaching and want an objective opinion about what you should do based on your goals, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.<br>&nbsp;
