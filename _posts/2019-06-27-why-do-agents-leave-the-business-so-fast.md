A 2014 NAR study found that 87% of Realtors exit the business within their first five years and another 75% fail in their very first year. What’s the reason for this alarmingly high failure rate? Well, there are actually five reasons and I’ll share them with you today:&nbsp;

**1\. Not being committed to success.** Quite a few newly licensed agents enter the business with the faulty belief that they’ll be able to make a great deal of money and do what they want and when they want to do it. This type of agent hasn’t made a real commitment to success.&nbsp;

**2\. Not being strategic.** Other new agents think there’s nothing left to learn once they’re out of schooling and now that they’re the licensed, people are going to be lining up at their door to do deals. In reality, you’ll never cease to learn in this business, so if you’re a new agent, learn your market and how you fit into its cycles.&nbsp;

**3\. Not having a role model.** For a beginner, having an accomplished, seasoned agent who’s personally had to overcome the ups and downs is so important. That can be tough to find, but that’s why I constantly underscore the value of being on a team. A team leader is a great person to look to. Nevertheless, there are plenty of agents with experience and expertise in their repertoire, so find one and study how they operate.&nbsp;

**4\. Not having sales skills.** The three skills that are instrumental to your success are selling, marketing, and negotiating. You need to be well trained and well developed in all three areas to be a successful Realtor. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**5\. Not having enough money saved to be a full-time agent.** Unbeknownst to a lot of part-time agents, most buyers and sellers would much prefer to work with an agent who’s full-time. If you must work another full-time job while you’re getting your feet wet in the business, you’ll need to save every penny you can. This way, you can quit that job much faster and begin to dedicate your time, energy, and effort to your success as an agent. Your success depends on your ability to stay focused and committed and develop a strong work ethic.&nbsp;
