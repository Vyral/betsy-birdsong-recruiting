So what are the differences between being a buyer’s agent and a listing agent? Here are just a few:

**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. A buyer’s agent needs to be more empathetic.** You need to have the ability to form a strong rapport with your clients and really care about those individuals you’re working with. Most of your clients will likely be first-time homebuyers who need to believe that you’re giving them truthful answers and that you’ll help them every step of the way. You need to have a personality that clicks with that mentality—some people just don’t.

**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Buyer’s agents do a lot more prospecting.** You need to have a lead generation system that will give you lots of internet leads. But how do you reach those people? By picking up a phone. I know that making phone calls is really difficult for some people these days. However, to successfully prospect, you’ll need to be on the phone making calls to prospective clients. Understand that even if you don’t get a response, it might not be that they’re rejecting you; it could just be that they’re not ready at the moment. In addition, you’ll also be spending your time on buyer appointments, in which you’ll sit down with buyers and take them through the whole process via a buyer presentation. You’ll need to get them to want to work with you since they have a lot of choices as far as agents go; then you’ll need to help them figure out what they need to do to move forward, like getting pre-qualified, going to showings, and more.

**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Listing agents need to be more assertive.** A great listing agent has their listing presentation down, they march into a house with assertiveness, and they have a track record to back up their confidence. They’ll be able to explain what they’re going to do for their sellers in strong terms, knowing that they usually only have one shot at getting a deal.

**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Listing agents need to have upfront money.** As a listing agent, you’ll need to have the money to do the marketing—good marketing will include more than just putting up a sign and adding the listing to a couple of websites.

&nbsp; **&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Listing agents need to have a good sense of communication.** Sellers want to be in the know regarding the process of selling their home, so you’ll need to keep in regular and consistent contact with them.

For many, it seems like we’re all the same—a Realtor is a Realtor. However, that’s absolutely not true. If you’re on the fence and don’t know which way to go, my business gives potential agents the DiSC profile, which helps them understand their personality and ultimately which path is better suited for them.
