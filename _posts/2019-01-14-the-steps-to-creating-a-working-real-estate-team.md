Once you get so busy that you realize you can’t do everything and you’re kind of stymied in your growth because there aren’t enough hours in a day, **it’s time to make that first hire**—if you have an entrepreneurial spirit.

The first hire I recommend is an administrative assistant. **An administrative assistant will allow you to do and focus on the things that will make you more money** by taking the administrative tasks off your plate. Let them help you build up systems and processes for your business, because that is what they’re going to be good at.

Your second hire should be an inside salesperson. I’ll bet that you thought I was going to say ‘buyer’s agent,’ but that’s not at all my recommendation. Don’t rush hiring a buyer’s agent; you’re not ready for that at this stage. With all your administrative tasks off your shoulders, **you should have the time to hire and train that inside salesperson, whose job it will be to set up appointments and nurture your prospects. &nbsp;**

Now that all the paperwork and customer service has been taken off your shoulders, what can you do next?

At this stage, you’ll be handling all your listing appointments, and once you get your new hires under your belt and all your tasks settled, then it will be time **to hire buyer’s agents.** My recommendation is to hire two—it’s just as easy to hire two as it is to hire one, and both can be trained at the same time. Worst case scenario: If one of them doesn’t work out, you’re not left with no one, and then you have someone to allow you to focus on finding two more.

**Once you have the core group working together, then you can add more people to your team.** You could hire a courier to work part-time delivering lockboxes, signs, open house advertisements, etc. You can also hire another administrative assistant, allowing one to focus on closing coordination and the other on being a listing manager. After that, you can work on a listing partner, allowing you to double your listing business. Finally, I’d recommend hiring an office manager to oversee running the day-to-day functions of the office.

Ultimately, **there is a right way and a right order for creating a successful team.** Remember not to get ahead of yourself, and don’t compromise on your hiring. Hire the right person for the right job; it will save you a whole lot of grief and help you and your team be successful.
