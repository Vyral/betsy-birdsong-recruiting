As an observer of other agents, I’m very interested in the way they talk and work with their clients. From my experience, I’ve found that coming across as a consultant to clients creates a sense of trust and allays their concerns that you’re simply a salesperson desperately trying to close a sale.&nbsp;

When you first meet with them, **you need to listen intently to what your clients have to say and respond with absolute honesty.** If you’re not able to provide them the service they deserve, let them know straight away. Believe me, you’ll get much further in life and in sales when you build a reputation as an honest person.

**Part of being honest with clients is making sure they understand they won’t necessarily get everything they want**, rather than merely telling them what they want. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to confrontation. In my business, I ask clients to write out a list of their needs and wants before I take them house-hunting. That way, when we’re looking at homes, they can refer back to that list for comparison.&nbsp;

For example, say you have a client who wants to live in Lakeview, and they’re looking for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath house on a $300,000 budget. Being the honest agent you are, you need to tell them from the outset that they won’t have any luck finding that home for that price in that area. Think about it: Isn’t it better to be honest with your client up front than to show them 20 or 30 homes that they can’t afford? Not only will this be a big waste of everyone’s valuable time, but your client will just go find another agent who doesn’t shy away from being up front and honest.&nbsp;

As the expert, **it’s your job to demonstrate your expertise by guiding them with strong communication skills.** The best way to build trust and rapport in this business is to find out what your clients want and advise them on whether their aims are realistic.&nbsp;
