I frequently research real estate trends that pertain to all kinds of topics, and I recently came across an article from realtor.com that details the six habits of successful agents that I want to share with you. To read the article in its entirety, [check out this link](https://www.realtor.com › advice › news › six-habits-of-successful-agents){: target="_blank"}. In the meantime, here are the six habits it lists:

1\. **They return calls and emails immediately.** If someone calls, emails, or texts you, you need to respond quickly. However they reach out to you is probably their preferred means of communication.&nbsp;

2\. **They utilize the latest technology.** You need to have a smartphone with a great data plan. Also, keep your voicemail clear and don’t let your battery run out. It also helps to have an electronic signature program. You don’t have to have every gadget, but utilizing the latest technology is important for your business.&nbsp;

3\. **They know the neighborhoods they work intimately.** You don’t have to be an agent who only works one neighborhood, but some very successful agents in the New Orleans area do just that. Regardless of how many neighborhoods you work, you need to know what houses are priced at and selling for per square foot in those neighborhoods. If you’re not doing much business in a certain neighborhood, of course, you won’t have this information at the tip of your tongue. If you do a lot of business in a certain neighborhood, though, it’s your job to know it intimately.&nbsp;

4\. **They explain everything they do.** This means you must explain your processes to your clients every step of the way. Some Realtors expect clients to follow them through every step, and the crazy thing is, those Realtors oftentimes don’t even know what they’re doing very well. &nbsp;

5\. **They creatively seek leads.** This means when you get a listing, you can’t just put up a “For Sale” sign in its front yard, list it on the MLS, make a single Facebook post about it, and expect leads to fall out of the sky. Good agents get creative to find leads—they collaborate with others to see what works best.&nbsp;

For example, try sending postcards, but be mindful of what’s said on the postcard and don’t just stop after sending just one—keep sending them. Some people say the magic number is between six and seven tries if you want to get the biggest bang for your buck. Of course, that’s expensive, but you have to test every avenue. There are also several other social media platforms you can use besides Facebook including Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc. Everything is different, so experiment and figure out what works best for you.&nbsp;

6\. **They maintain a helpful network.** They have a list of the best agents, tradespeople, contractors, appraisers, lenders, and so on. Today, in fact, I got a call from a tree service professional who heard through the grapevine that one of my listings needed trees cut around the property, so I referred them to the seller and added them to my vendor list. Build a network of people who maintain their own networks, because they can be great referral partners.&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about this subject or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to pick up the phone and give me a call. I’d love to talk to you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
