As an agent, there’s a certain way you need to interact when talking with sellers over the phone, but there’s one thing you need to remember above all else: **You must ask the right questions.&nbsp;**

There’s a lot of information you need to know about a home you’re possibly going to list, but two questions in particular take priority over that information:

**1\. Do you know what your home is worth?<br>2\. What are your expectations of me as an agent?**

You want to know the answers to these questions before you meet the seller.

When it comes to price, you and the seller may have different opinions, so that’s definitely a discussion you need to have with them right away so you’ll know how to delve deeper during the listing appointment.

Regarding their expectations of you, you need to know how often they like to be communicated with and what means of communication they prefer. If you don’t inquire about this type of thing, they’ll feel like you’re not doing a good job for them. Some people still like to talk on the phone, while others prefer to communicate via text. In any case, don’t make assumptions about how a person prefers to be communicated with based on their age.
