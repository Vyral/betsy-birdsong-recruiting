When you receive your real estate license, your education is only beginning. No matter how many closings you’ve produced, there’s always something new to learn.

**Think of it as needing the equivalent of a college degree in real estate.** So, how are you going to get it? The 12 hours of continuing education each year won’t get you where you need to be—you need an ongoing learning resource.

I believe team leaders should be involved in a national coaching program. **Then, their agents will receive the benefits from their leader by extension.** Agents should also be able to get the materials from the coaching program. In addition, the team leader should provide scripts, CRMs, database management services, and education on time blocking and goal setting.

You should also have education on listing and buyer presentations, social media usage, and lead conversion.

If you’re in a brokerage but not with a team, **your company should provide ongoing training.** Pick a place where they’re constantly helping you grow and thrive. We provide ongoing education to our team through a variety of ways, and as a part of eXp Realty, we can take advantage of their weekly live training and upcoming university program.

And no matter how long you’ve been a Realtor, it’s always important to have an accountability partner—someone who will help you stay on track.

**A career in real estate requires constant, ongoing education.** There’s always more to learn, so you should do everything you can, as an agent, to grow. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
