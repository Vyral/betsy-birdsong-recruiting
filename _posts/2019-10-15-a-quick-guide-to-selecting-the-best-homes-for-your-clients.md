When it comes to selecting homes to show your buyer clients, here are a few tips that will help the process go smoothly and quickly. &nbsp;

First, keep in mind that **you only want to show them a maximum of 10 houses.** I know what you might be thinking right about now: “How in the world am I going to be able to do that?”&nbsp;

Well, if you provide them a buyer’s consultation at the very beginning of the process, you shouldn’t have to show them a whole bunch of houses. Buyers are busy these days, just like you are, and they want things to move quickly.&nbsp;

I like to streamline the process by having a conversation with my clients about which features are non-negotiable to them for their new home. It’s essential that you find out what a client really wants. Also, there’s a difference between what they want and what they need, so you need to find out what they need too.&nbsp;

Sometimes buyers walk into a house and get emotional about it, but you know that their needs don’t correspond to that house, so you have to remind them about your previous conversations. Our clients shouldn’t have to tour 50 homes to learn something we already know, so as you tour homes, be sure to ask them if they’re comfortable with the choices they’re making.&nbsp;

Next, **make sure you listen.** Sometimes clients will tell you to show them things, but it’s not what they need or want, so you need great listening skills. If you’ve toured dozens of homes and still haven’t found one, perhaps it’s time to have a reevaluation conversation and rediscover what they really want and need. You might have to start the process all over again.&nbsp;

Remember, the goal is to help your client find a house and do so in a timely manner.&nbsp;
