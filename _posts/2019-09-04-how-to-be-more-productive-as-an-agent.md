Agents always ask me all the time what tools I use to increase my productivity, so today I’ll reveal my most important resource. &nbsp;

**The No. 1 tool in my productivity arsenal is my Google Calendar, which I use to timeblock my days.** I put absolutely every activity into my Google Calendar, whether it's prospecting, attending appointments, or even spending personal time. I record it all.&nbsp;

This method has been very helpful for me, so I strongly urge all of you to try it. To start, print out a blank monthly calendar and go to town using a pencil with an eraser. This will allow you to make changes as they arise.&nbsp;

Record prospecting time first, as this is something most agents aren’t thrilled about doing. Writing it down right away will help you stick to it. The best time to prospect is between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., Monday through Friday. The second best time to do so is between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on those same days.&nbsp;

**Full-time agents should prospect for at least two hours a day, five days a week.** Part-time agents, meanwhile, should spend at least five hours a week on prospecting.&nbsp;

Once you’re done blocking out time to prospect, it’s time to set aside time in your calendar for follow-up calls. Then, do the same for client appointments. It might not seem like you can be too specific about the times at which you’ll do these things, but it’s not as difficult as you think. The one area you might need to be flexible in is closings.&nbsp;

When you’re in control of your time, instead of letting your time be in control of you, your business and personal life will thrive. **Contrary to what you might expect, time blocking helps you live life more freely.** If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
